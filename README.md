# Advent of Code (2023)

C++ project to solve 2023's Advent of Code challenges.

Things I want to learn:
- Various language features of C++ for writing algorithms
- Using CMake to build and configure my C++ project
- Writing software tests for C++ code
- Using the standard library and perhaps third-party libraries with CMake
