## Goals

- Getting more comfortable with C++, its more intricate language features and its standard library
- Learning to use CMake as a build system to compile C++ executables and libraries
- Using Windows and Visual Studio to develop software, instead of only on Linux
- Perhaps learning to use some third-party C++ libraries
- Using GTest for tests and ensuring clean code that can be easily refactored
